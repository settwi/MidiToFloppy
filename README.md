# MidiToFloppy 
# Floppy Drive Music
Personal codebase of a project I've been working on for floppy drive music. Arduino code is at "version 1.0," if I may.

Okay - this is a bit of a mess of a project. It works, but it ain't exactly pretty. I will (some day,) publish the details of my thoughts behind every single aspect of this project, so hopefully any fellow Arduino-er will be able to replicate what I've done in some manner or other.
