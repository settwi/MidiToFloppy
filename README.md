# MidiToFloppy
Personal codebase of a project I've been working on for floppy drive music. Arduino code is at "version 1.0," if I may.

Okay - this is a bit of a mess of a project. It works, but it aint exactly pretty. I will (some day,) publish the details of my thoughts behind every single aspect of this project, so hopefully any fellow Arduino-er will be able to replicate what I've done in some manner or other.

This project has taken literally 80+ hours of work, mostly getting the MIDI-conversion program working. Even that is buggy... but it works approximatly 90%, so I am not complaining.
